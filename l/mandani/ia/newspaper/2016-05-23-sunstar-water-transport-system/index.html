THE developer of a waterfront project in Mandaue City has expressed interest to coordinate with the government on a possible ferry transport system to operate in the area.
</p>

<p>Taft Property Venture Development Corp. president Christopher Narciso said Mandani Bay in the North Reclamation Area can support such a development.</p>
<blockquote>
“We have been coordinating with them (government) regarding provisions for a marina along our waterfront, a ferry transport to traverse (Mactan Island to Cebu),”</blockquote>
<p>
Narciso told reporters at the grand launch of its 1,500-square-meter Mandani Bay show gallery last week.</p>
<p>
As traffic worsens in Mandaue City with the influx of vehicles to and from the cities of Cebu, Mandaue, and Lapu-Lapu, a ferry transport system would be a viable alternative.
Since last week, drivers and commuters complained about the heavy traffic on the two bridges linking Mactan and Mandaue.

<blockquote>
“We can’t say with certainty (when)..but we are committed to support it,” Narciso said. Asked if this will be a public private partnership (PPP), he said this will depend on the decision of the authorities.</blockquote>
<p>
Mandani Bay, a joint venture project of Taft Properties and Hongkong Land, takes inspiration from to world-class waterfront destinations like the Thames River in London, Manhattan in New York, the Sydney Harbour, Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong, and the Marina Bay in Singapore.</p>
<p>
The project is envisioned to transform Mandaue City into a premium lifestyle destination.
The waterfront development will occupy a 20-hectare lot and will be developed in eight phases. It is composed of 25 towers, 80 percent of which is for residential use.</p>
<p>
The rest will be for commercial and retail functions.
Hongkong Land Philippines chief representative Finn Carew said it may take them 15 years to compelete the entire development.</p>
<p>
In this phase of transition in government, Carew said condominium sales have not been affected. </p>
<blockquote>“Sales take up has been very strong, despite this time of change,” he said. Most of the buyers are Cebuano families.</blockquote>
<p>
Condomium units at Mandani Bay are currently sold at P2.8 million up to P28 million each.
