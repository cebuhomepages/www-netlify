The Mandani Bay Show Gallery located at F.E. Zuellig Avenue marks the first completed structure in the entire waterfront township. The developer’s first residential property, Mandani Bay Suites, is slated to finish by 2020 and the full-scale exhibition area is already open for interested buyers. The gallery showcases an experiential display of the scale models of the entire waterfront property as well as the showroom for the studios and units that are available for buyers.

The projected completion for the whole township project is in 15 years in anticipation that all factors of the development will go as planned. Eight phases will be implemented towards completion and 80 percent of the entire property will be for residential use. A total of 25 towers are expected to rise around it, with expansive podium blocks interconnected by footbridges that will connect residents to all the amenities within the property as well as the retail and activity spaces.

<p>The joint development venture of Hongkong Land with Taft Properties is by far the biggest property project of the international firm in the Philippines. In Manila, the developer currently has an existing partnership with Ayala Land Inc. for the development of Roxas Land Corp., soon to rise at the former location of Mandarin Hotel in Makati. </p>
