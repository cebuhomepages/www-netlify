<p>
   Cebu is slowly establishing itself as a world-class lifestyle destination with the joint development of Hongkong Land and Taft Properties, the 20-hectare Mandani Bay. Situated along the Mactan Channel in Mandaue City, the property is being developed around the concept of connected lifestyle, integrating culture, creativity, adventure, and water in the design of the residential towers, amenities, and retail front.

The staggering 130 billion-peso development is the first of its kind in Cebu, marking a turning point for the kinds of projects that the local market is interested in. In the words of local developer Taft Properties’ COO, Christopher Narciso: 



 </p>
 <blockquote>“Cebu’s higher GDP growth compared to the national average, the continuous growth of different industries in the province especially the BPO, and the flow of remittances in the general area, led to the increasing demand of residential development.”</blockquote>

<p>As the first step in bringing this vision to life, Mandani Bay opens its 1,500-square metre show gallery, which is the lone finished structure within the developing compound. The space gives an initial taste of what people can expect from the general integrated design of the property once it is completed in a matter of 15 years.

<p>Upon entry to the show gallery, the main gallery’s grand ceiling serves as the welcoming sight. But the focal point of the section is the scale model of the entirety of Mandani Bay, which was created in Hong Kong. The show gallery also houses a kid’s room where parents can keep their children as they go around and explore the sample units of the residential towers.</p>
<p>The showrooms that occupy the confined rooms within the gallery perfectly showcase the furnished units of the residential towers. Among the units available for viewing are the 30-square-metre one bedroom unit, 82-sqaure-metre two-bedroom unit with balcony, and the 87-square-metre two-bedroom loft unit with floor-to-ceiling windows.
