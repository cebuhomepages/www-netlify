<p>
  The visionary partnership between Taft Properties and Hongkong Land is set out to accomplish a transformation in Cebu that brings out a distinctively defined lifestyle. The resulting project of this joint venture is the much talked-about, premium mixed-use development Mandani Bay.
</p>
<p>
Cebu is rich in history, and this is the start of the Mandani Bay narrative. There is a parallelism among places that started out as discoveries by European explorers, just like Manhattan and Sydney, and most other urban destinations in the world. </p>

<p>How do the brilliant minds that make up Taft Properties and Hongkong Land see Mandani Bay take us to this new era of progress? They do this, of course, by transforming a city, a physical transformation that births a new way of life.
</p>
<p>
Every corner of the Mandani Bay master plan embodies a plush, aesthetic sensibility that inspires imagination, creation and innovation. Expansive podium blocks are interconnected by footbridges.
</p>

<p>
  From a distance, Mandani Bay is a glittering metropolitan wonder. Spanning 20 hectares of land, it lies majestic on a waterfront along the Mactan Channel in Mandaue City, providing a stunning view of the coast and encompassing cityscape.
</p>

<p>
  With the marriage of land and sea prominent at Mandani Bay, another aspect of the progressive lifestyle is tapped into, one that is for adventure. One may bike around, climb walls, or conquer the waterâ€”whatever the spirit desires.
</p>

<p>
  In essence, Mandani Bay is a project that not just physically transforms Cebu not just into a bigger metropolitan giant, but also transforms individuals in their very core, inspiring a new kind of metropolitan lifestyle that is only possible in a progressive seaside township such as Mandani Bay.
