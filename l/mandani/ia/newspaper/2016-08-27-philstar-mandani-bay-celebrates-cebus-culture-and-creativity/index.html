  Soon to join the iconic waterfront destinations such as the  Thames River in London, Manhattan in New York, the Sydney Harbour in Australia,  Marina Bay in Singapore, Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong, is Mactan Cebu’s  Mandani Bay.
</p>
<p>
The 20-hectare waterfront development, a joint venture of Hong Kong Land and Taft Properties, was recently launched in an affair that celebrated Cebuano culture and creativity while giving guests a glimpse of the world-class lifestyle destination that will put Cebu on the global map. </p>

<p>The ceremony started with the traditional ribbon cutting led by chief representative of Hong Kong Land in the Philippines Finn Carew, Taft Properties chief operating officer Christopher Narciso, Taft Properties chairman Jack Gaisano, Hong Kong Land executive director Robert Wong,  Mandaue City Mayor Luigi Quisumbing, Mandaue City Vice Mayor Carlo Fortuna and Cebu Vice Governor elect Agnes Magpale. Also in attendance were Cebu 6th District Congressman elect Jonas Cortes and Cordova Mayor Adelino Sitoy. The recently crowned Miss Mandaue 2016 Malka Shaver and second runner-up Luzenne Jones also attended the event.
</p>

The program featured  award-winning Cebuano performers such as the multi-awarded Mandaue Children’s Choir, the Cebu Classic Youth Orchestra,  the University of Cebu Dance Company and versatile soprano  Windey Prado  culminating   with a fabulous fireworks display.
