<p>Built around a lifestyle of connectivity, this premium mixed-use community hosts a series of expansive podium blocks interconnected by footbridges. Residential towers rise from each of the podiums' amenity roof decks, whilst street front retail thrives along the wide boulevards.</p>
    
<p>At the base, the buildings are also connected by a system of exclusive parking spaces weaving throughout the property. For strolling aboveground or driving and parking underground, Mandani Bay provides complete convenience allowing time for loftier pursuits.</p>

<p>Mandani Bay has set the bar for a new era of development in the Philippines.</p>

<h1> The Story </h1>

<p>Arriving in Cebu in the 1500s with Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian scholar, writes in his book, “First Voyage Around the World”, of a chieftain named Apo Noan from a settlement called ‘Mandani’, known today as Mandaue. Inspired by this rich chapter of Cebu’s history, Mandaue’s premier modern community embraces its storied past as it looks to the future.</p>

<h1> The Location </h1>      
<p>With Cebu in the center of the Philippines, and the Philippines at the center of the Asia-Pacific region, its location is a strategic jump off point to all points in the region. Which also explains why Cebu has always played a vital role in trade and commerce in Asia, even before its colonisation by Spain.</p>
<p>On the east of Mandani Bay, a scenic stretch of wharfs rolls out onto a broad view of the Osmeña Bridge and the urban scenery beyond. To the west, the development will have easy access to Cebu Business Park and Cebu City</p>
