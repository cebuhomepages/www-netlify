title: 2 Lessons from a Bank Loan Application

description: After you finish paying for the equity, it's now time to apply for a bank loan to shoulder the remaining balance from the total price. I'll share you 2 lessons we learned from a bumpy transaction we had with a client.

---

We have an OFW client, based in Singapore, who bought a condo in [Midori Resisdneces][midori]. He recently finished his equity period last year and is now about to have his unit turned over to him. However, he won't be able to get the unit, even if he has fully paid the 15% equity, unless he gets his <strong>85% bank loan approved<strong>. He started processing his [bank loan][bankloan] but got into some delays and problems. 

## He has 2 problems:
- ###1. He applied to only 1 bank and the bank was very slow in processing his loan. It took 3 months for them to approve it. That's a waste of time.

- ###2. Making matters worse, the bank didn't grant him the 85% bank loan. He was only granted 70% of the total balance. He has to cash out the 15% which would amount to around Php 200,000. That's a huge amount of money. 

That's a big hassle on his part, because he was thinking it would be a smooth sale after the bank loan approval.

## Lesson Learned
Here's a couple of take aways from this situation. 

- ###1. Apply Early
You have to apply for the bank loan months before the target turnover of the unit. For our clients, we start processing their loans 6 months before the turnover date. Ask your broker if she can start processing your bank loan as early as possible.

- ###2. Apply to Many
You have to apply for multiple banks. This would [benefit you][benefitsofmultibank] because you'll be in a better position to choose. You'll just be collecting and selecting the banks that got you approved. Another reason for this is that banks now are offering lower interest rates than the other. they are racing to the bottom, just to get your account. You'll be choosing the bank offering the lowest interest rate at the best term. That's a big win for you. <br/> Ask your broker to endorse you to multiple banks.
