title: How to connect with your broker
---

In real estate, communication plays a key tool in decision making. The more you communicate with your real estate broker, the better information you get, leading to a better decision you can make.

For the last couple of decades, the world has become smaller. We can almost reach anyone, anywhere … **all in an instant**. Communication has evolved and it is now easier for us to connect with one another.

For you to reach the best decision in buying a property, you should connect with your broker. And it is easier than ever.

- **Facebook**- I put this as the top of my list because, it is through facebook that you found out about this. Yes! you can always connect with your real estate broker through giving them a “private message” PM. 
- **Email** - be it yahoomail or gmail, you can compose a short messages for inquiries and request for a detailed information. This is also the most useful tool to send documents.
- **Call** - This mode of communication has been the best way to communicate. It was before … it is still now. 
- **Text** - Best for short messages. This is totally useful during meetings and coordinating during a site visit.
- **Skpe** - the most commonly used video conferencing app. You can talk *face to face*, over the internet … And the best part is, it is FREE! 

And with the advent of smartphones, you can do all of these things on the go.

## Now it’s your turn, connect with me.

You can connect with me now through facebook or email. It's now easier than ever.
