## Mall Experience
So you went to SM on a weekend and you stroll around the lower ground floor. You notice someone hand you a flyer of a beautiful house. You checked the project.. seems nice, looks great and wished this can be yours. 

You continue to walk another hop and another one hands you a different flyer. You checked at the persons face and you can see the eagerness to talk to you was all over him. If you’d walk the entire floor stretch and be kind enough to receive all the flyers, your hands will be full of it. You take 1 and flipped over, you see a name and contact information. You wondered, who are these people selling me houses?

## Ceboom!
With the booming real estate industry in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/cebu" target="_blank">#Cebu</a>, there is an increasingly noticeable visibility of real estate salesperson around the city. We often see them in malls and parks, handing out flyers and selling us wonderful and appealing homes. 

## Identifying good ones.
One of the biggest decisions in a Cebuano’s life is buying or selling a house, apartment, a condominium or generally a property, this is where a real estate agent or broker can help you negotiate and pass through what can be a confusing process -- taxes, titling and name transfers, etc.

So how do you choose an agent?

So before you dig into those flyers and skim through the names and contacts, here’s some heads up tips:

- **Ask people you trust for any recommendations**. Did they recently buy a home in that same price range you are looking for. How was their experience with their agent? 

- **Make sure she/he is knowledgeable**..that’s just a given. Beyond that, she should be someone you can ask your doubts to. Approachable and professional.

- **Look up the licensing**. With the explosion of the real estate industry, it is safe to know that you are dealing with a licensed professional. Ask the agent for her license to practice, as issued by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) - <a href="http://www.prc.gov.ph/" target="_blank">http://www.prc.gov.ph/</a>.

- **Research the agent’s profile**. With the rise of social networks, everyone now has a face to name. And even more so, at a glance you can tell how that sales agent is well received by her friends and the community. 

- **Ask "How will you keep me informed about the progress of my transaction? How frequently?"**Using what media? Again, this is not a question with a correct answer, but that one reflects your desires.

- **Make sure your agent is online**. Having a web savvy agent is very important today as over 85% of all buyers initially see their homes online. Great agents have laptops and often have moved to mobile technology to assist. A real estate agent in today's world must email, text, and be available to buyers and sellers alike.

- The most important thing is, **make sure you get along with the agent**. You don’t need to be best friends, but ultimately there should be some sort of rapport that allows for a successful business relationship.
