Thanks for stopping and checking me out.

My name is Luchelle Ann Joren-Cabigon and I have worked in Real Estates since 2011. I've got my PRC License since 2009, but focused on practicing my profession a year or two later.

My clients have ranged from young professionals and young at heart investors, to close friends who are into real estate investing. My clients, amazingly turned out to become friends of mine too.

However, I'm best known for helping first time home buyers and families who become home owners. I have also helped a foreign client make a real estate investment here. I'm also providing services for Overseas Filipino Workers, who want to place their hard earned money in real estates.

I'm able to achieve this by sharing insights on how to buy or invest in real estates here in the Philippines and provide you with the latest updates on the developing metropolis.

My key strength is that I'm very diligent and I have a good relationships with developers that I'm accredited in. Because of this, I get good information from their projects, which I can present to my clients clearly. Having the right information is massively beneficial to my clients and critical in their decision making.

Typically, my clients are busy professionals who have no time to research on the best real estate investments here in Cebu. I guide them on how to go about buying a condominium or a house and lot. They've decided to seek for professional real estate help they can trust.

## End to End Service

My service to my clients covers from choosing a property to reservation agreement signing to requirements gathering to loan application and processing. I'd be there 'till you can move in to your unit or home.
